This Plugin adds actions for rightclicking on your signs.

You can add an arbitrary number of Commands which will be executed by right-clicking the Sign. These Commands will be executed on a location defined by you! You also have the opportunity to set the needed permission to use the sign. You can also give temporary permissions to a player for executing the commands.
Creating a CommandSign

To create a CommandSign you must first place a Sign. Then you type "/ecs create" and rightclick the Sign to register this Sign in ECS's Database.
Adding Commands

Type "/ecs addcommand <Your command here>" to add a command. You must type the leading slash if it is an command. Otherwise the player would chat. "/ecs addcommand time set 0" -> The Player sends the Message "time set 0" on rightclicking. "/ecs addcommand /time set 0" -> The Player executes the command "/time set 0" on rightclicking.
Adding temporary Permissions

Type "/ecs addperm <Your permission here>" to add temporary permissions to the player. These temporary permissions allow the player to execute commands which they normally are not allowed to. The permissions are revoked after the command executung process.
Set the required permission to use this Sign

Type "/ecs setperm <Your permission here>" to set the required permission. The player must have this permission if he wants to use this sign.
Set the position where the plugins are executed

First move to the location where the commands should be executed. Then type "/ecs setloc" and right-click your sign. This is multiworld compatible.
Set the Sign to OP-only

Type "/ecs setop <true | false>" and then right click the sign.
Get Info about any CommandSign

Type "/ecs info" and rightclick the Sign.
Remove a Sign

Type "/ecs remove" and rightclick a CommandSign.
Commands

    /ecs create - Perm: ecs.admin - Creates a new Sign
    /ecs addcommand [optional: "id <value>"] <command> - Perm: ecs.admin - Adds a command
    /ecs addperm [optional: "id <value>"] <permission> - Perm: ecs.admin - Adds a temporary permission
    /ecs setperm [optional: "id <value>"] <permission> - Perm: ecs.admin - Sets the required permission. Default is ecs.use
    /ecs setloc [optional: "id <value>"] - Perm: ecs.admin - Sets the location of the commands execute
    /ecs setop [optional: "id <value>"] <true | false> - Perm: ecs.admin - Sets this sign op-only
    /ecs info - Perm: ecs.info - Gets info about this sign
    /ecs remove [optional: "id <value>"] - Perm: ecs.admin - removes this sign
    /ecs reload - Perm: ecs.reload - Reloads the plugins database 

Instead of rightclicking the sign everytime you can place a "id <Sign-id>" between the command and the argument. example: /ecs addcommand id 2 /time set 0 - this adds the command "/time set 0" to the sign with id 2. The id can be seen in the info of the sign.
Intended Upgrades

    Add the ability to remove and modify a command or permission without editing the Database. Currently you must recreate a sign to remove sth of it.
    Add the ability to prevent the command-executing plugins to send the player messages.
    Make use of the config.yml.
